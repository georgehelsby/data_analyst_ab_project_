### A/B Testing Project for Data Analyst Nanodegree

This is my 2nd project for my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. 

It involves hypothesis testing and CLT in order to evaluate whether a company should implement a new website landing page.

A sample dataset is given in which around 1/2 of the website viewers are the 'control' group and are shown the original landing page, and half are the 'treatment' group and are shown a new landing page.

A 'clicked through' metric is provided for measuring the effectiveness of each landing page in driving 'conversions'.
Also known as click-through rate.

### Part I - Probability
Using simple pandas querying to find the raw probability for each group's conversion.


### Part I - A/B Testing
Using hypothesis testing and ClT to gauge whether the landing page changes are statistically significant.

### Part I - Regresssion
Use logistic regression to evaluate the landing page's effect on CTR.

### Part I - Conclusion
Using all three methods I concluded that the website should not implement the new landing page
