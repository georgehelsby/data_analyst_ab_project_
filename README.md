### A/B Testing Project for Data Analyst Nanodegree

This is my 2nd project for my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. 

It involves hypothesis testing and CLT in order to evaluate whether a company should implement a new website landing page.

A sample dataset is given in which around 1/2 of the website viewers are shown the original landing page, and half are shown a new landing page.

A 'clicked through' metric is provided for measuring the effectiveness of each landing page in driving 'conversions'.
Also known as click-through rate.
